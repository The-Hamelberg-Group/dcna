Requirements
============
You need following software installed:
 * R (>3.0)
 * bio3d.core, bio3d.cna, and their dependent R packages (Dependent packages will be installed automatically)
   (Check out https://bitbucket.org/Grantlab/bio3d for how to install the Bio3D family packages)

and also pre-calculated input files:
 * contact statistics files directly obtained from 'creat_mean_contact.sh'
   (e.g. the 'free' and 'cis' files under the example directory.)
 * a pdb file matching the contact results

How to run:
==========
 * open 'run_path_analysis.r', modify the file names (and optionally parameters) to fit your case.
 * In a shell terminal, start an R session by typing `R` and return.
 * In the R session, type `source('run_path_analysis.r')`.
 * The last printed on the screen is a table showing node degeneracy values. You can reproduce it by typing:
     print(pa, pdb=pdb)
 * A quick (and rough) graph representation of node degeneracy and path length distribution can be obtained by:
     plot(pa, pdb=pdb)
 * 3D view of paths is enabled with VMD:
   - Before quiting R, save the result for future uses (e.g., save(pa, file="pa.RData")).
   - In a shell terminal, type `vmd` and return to open VMD.
   - In the VMD terminal, type `source paths.vmd` (the .vmd filename is set in the run_path_analysis.r file)
