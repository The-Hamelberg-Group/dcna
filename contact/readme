Step 1. Compile the codes.

make

Step 2. Make a text file containing a list of MD files you want to analyze. The first file in the list should be the topology file of the MD. See the "mdlist" file for an example.
NOTE: Simulations MUST be generated by Amber!


Step 3. Type following command to compute contact statistics:

./creat_mean_contact.sh mdlist 12

where '12' is the number of cores to use. NOTE: if you have substrate/ligand and you want to strip them, modify the "strip2" variable in the script files (located in the top a few lines).


Step 4 (Optional). Generate contact trajectory.

./generate_per_frame_contact.sh mdlist 12
