# Requirements
## You need the following software installed:
 * R (>3.0)
 * bio3d and related R packages

## You need the following pre-calculated input files:
 * contact statistics files directly obtained from 'creat_mean_contact.sh'
   (e.g. the 'free' and 'cis' files under the example directory.)
 * a pdb file matching the contact results

# How to run:
 * Copy the content of the 'append.vmdrc' file and paste it at the end of your ~/.vmdrc file
 * Open 'run_community_analysis.r', modify the parameters to fit your case
 * Start an R session by typing `R` and return in a linux shell
 * In the R session, type `source('run_community_analysis.r')`
 * Adjust the plot in the poped-up window; Keep the window open
 * Save the layout of community you just made in the interactive plotting window by following the commented commands in the script
 * Test the layout by replotting the communities in the regular way (following the commented commands in the script)
 * You may also adjust the vertex/edge size or the number of communities by following the commented commands in the script
 * Use regular ways of R to save the plot. For example, put `pdf(file="plot.pdf", height=4, width=4)` and `dev.off()` before and after calling the `plot_community()` function
 * In linux, type `vmd network.pdb -e network.vmd` to show communities in 3D.
