Requirements
============
 * Linux (CentOS 7.3 or similar)
 * gcc (>=4.8.5)
 * AmberTools (2014 or above; http://ambermd.org/)
 * R (>=3.0)
 * bio3d R package (>=2.3-4; http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/)
 * igraph R package (>=1.1.1; http://igraph.org/r/)

Optional:
 * VMD (>=1.9.3; http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)


Quick Start
===========
 * Calculate contact statistics from MD simulations
   cd contact
   make 
   (Edit "mdlist" file to match your case; See contact/readme for details)
   ./creat_mean_contact.sh mdlist 4   
   (NOTE: "4" indicates the number of cores to use and can be adjusted)
   cd ..

 * 2. Residue wise difference contact network
   cd bar
   (Edit "run_bar.r" file to match your case)
   Rscript run_bar.r
   (To visualize results, open files with VMD: vmd -e bar.vmd)
   cd ..

 * Community analysis
   cd community
   (Edit "run_community_analysis.r" to match your case)
   R 
   (In the R session, type "source('run_community_analysis.r')"
   (Adjust the plot in the poped-up window and save it as a pdf/eps file; Optionally, try commented out lines in the bottom of "run_community_analysis.r" for alternative ways to plot and for modularity evaluations)
   (To visualize results, open files with VMD in a linux shell (color the protein by chain IDs): vmd network.pdb. NOTE: you may need to append the content in the community/append.vmdrc file to ~/.vmdrc; otherwise, colors in the VMD graphic may not match those in the R plot window)
   cd ..
